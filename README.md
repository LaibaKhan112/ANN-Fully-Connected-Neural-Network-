🚀 **Exploring Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN) with the MNIST Dataset!** 🧠

I’ve been diving deeper into **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** and recently built a **Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)** to classify handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset**.

Here’s what I did:

- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**: Loaded and reshaped the 28x28 images into 784-dimensional vectors, normalized the pixel values, and applied one-hot encoding to the labels.
- 🧑‍💻 **Model Architecture**: Created a simple yet powerful neural network with:
  - 1 hidden layer with 400 neurons
  - 1 hidden layer with 20 neurons
  - Softmax output layer for multi-class classification
- 🏋️‍♂️ **Training**: Trained the model for 10 epochs using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and evaluated its performance on the test set.

✅ **Results**:
- The model achieved good accuracy in classifying the digits.
- Visualized the predictions alongside the actual images to get a better understanding of its performance.

🔍 This project is helping me get hands-on experience with deep learning concepts and model evaluation. I’m excited to keep pushing forward and exploring more advanced models like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**. Stay tuned for more updates on my AI journey!
